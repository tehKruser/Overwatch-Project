	<h3> Welcome! </h3>
	<p>Our database represents the Overwatch universe. Overwatch is a team based first person shooter video game with multiple heroes, 
	game modes, and maps. Animated shorts have also been made detailing the backstories of some of the heroes in the game. 
	This gave us a good number of options for entities and relationships in the Overwatch universe. 
	The complexity and obvious relationships between the different entities makes the Overwatch universe a good candidate for a database.</p>
